# NumPy and Pandas Learning Project

A comprehensive hands-on project to learn NumPy and Pandas - two essential Python libraries for data analysis and scientific computing.

## 📚 Project Structure

This project is organized into multiple phases, each building upon the previous one:

### **Phase 1: NumPy Fundamentals** (`phase1.ipynb`)
- Introduction to NumPy arrays
- Array creation and basic operations
- Vectors, matrices, and tensors
- Array properties (shape, size, dtype)
- Array reshaping, flattening, and transposing
- Creating arrays from scratch (zeros, ones, random, sequences)

### **Phase 2: NumPy Intermediate Operations** (`phase2.ipynb`)
- Array slicing and indexing
- 2D array manipulation
- Sorting arrays
- Filtering with boolean masks
- Using `np.where()` for conditional operations
- Adding and removing data (concatenate, vstack, hstack, delete)

### **Phase 3: NumPy Advanced Operations** (`phase3.ipynb`)
- Business use cases with real-world data
- Statistical operations (sum, mean, max, min)
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Vector operations (addition, multiplication, dot product, cross product)
- Vectorized operations for performance

### **Phase 4: Pandas Fundamentals** (`phase4.ipynb`)
- Introduction to Series and DataFrames
- Creating DataFrames from various sources
- Basic DataFrame operations
- Data selection and filtering
- Handling missing data
- Basic statistics with Pandas

### **Phase 5: Pandas Advanced & Integration** (`phase5.ipynb`)
- Data manipulation and transformation
- GroupBy operations
- Merging and joining DataFrames
- Time series analysis
- Reading/writing CSV and Excel files
- NumPy + Pandas integration examples

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd numpy
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment (if not already done):**
   ```bash
   # Already exists in your project as 'env'
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open any phase notebook** (phase1.ipynb, phase2.ipynb, etc.) and run the cells sequentially.
