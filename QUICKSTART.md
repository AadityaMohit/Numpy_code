### 📗 **Phase 2: NumPy Intermediate** (`phase2.ipynb`)
- ✅ Array slicing and indexing
- ✅ Sorting and filtering
- ✅ Adding and removing data
- ✅ Boolean masking

### 📙 **Phase 3: NumPy Advanced** (`phase3.ipynb`)
- ✅ Broadcasting operations
- ✅ Linear algebra (matrix multiplication, determinants, eigenvalues)
- ✅ Real business sales analysis example
- ✅ Data visualization with matplotlib

### 📕 **Phase 4: Pandas Fundamentals** (`phase4.ipynb`)
- ✅ Series and DataFrame creation
- ✅ Data selection and filtering
- ✅ Handling missing data
- ✅ Statistical operations
- ✅ Sorting and ranking

### 📔 **Phase 5: Advanced Pandas & Integration** (`phase5.ipynb`)
- ✅ GroupBy operations
- ✅ Merging and joining DataFrames
- ✅ Time series analysis
- ✅ CSV file I/O
- ✅ NumPy + Pandas integration
- ✅ Complete E-commerce analytics dashboard

## 🎯 How to Get Started

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

If pandas installation was interrupted, run:

```powershell
# Activate your virtual environment
.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1

# Install pandas
pip install pandas
```

Alternatively, install all requirements at once:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook

```powershell
# Make sure environment is activated
.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1

# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

Your browser will open automatically.

### Step 3: Open and Run Notebooks

1. Start with **phase1.ipynb** (NumPy basics)
2. Progress through each phase sequentially
3. Run cells one by one (Shift + Enter)
4. Experiment with the code!

## 📊 What You'll Learn

### NumPy Skills
- ✅ Efficient array operations
- ✅ Mathematical computations
- ✅ Linear algebra
- ✅ Statistical analysis
- ✅ Data visualization

### Pandas Skills
- ✅ DataFrame manipulation
- ✅ Data cleaning
- ✅ Grouping and aggregation
- ✅ Merging datasets
- ✅ Time series analysis
- ✅ File operations

## 💡 Project Highlights

### Real-World Examples Included:
- 📈 **Sales Analysis**: Track product performance, growth rates, and trends
- 🛒 **E-commerce Dashboard**: Complete analytics with 1000 orders
- 📊 **Customer Segmentation**: VIP, Regular, and Occasional customers
- 📉 **Time Series**: Daily sales with moving averages
- 💼 **Employee Data**: Merging departments, salaries, and employee info

## 🎨 Visualizations

Each notebook includes beautiful matplotlib visualizations:
- Line charts for trends
- Bar charts for comparisons
- Pie charts for distributions
- Histograms for data distribution
- Multi-panel dashboards

## 📝 Tips for Learning

1. **Read the comments** - Every code block is well-documented
2. **Modify values** - Change numbers and see what happens
3. **Add your own data** - Replace examples with your own datasets
4. **Run all cells** - See the complete output
5. **Save your changes** - Jupyter auto-saves, but use Ctrl+S

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If pandas is not installed:
```powershell
pip install pandas
```

### If matplotlib charts don't display:
```python
%matplotlib inline  # Add this at the top of notebooks
```

### If kernel is not found:
```powershell
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=env
```

## 📚 Next Steps

After completing all 5 phases:

1. **Practice with your own data**
   - Import CSV files from your projects
   - Apply the techniques you've learned

2. **Explore more advanced topics**
   - Machine learning with scikit-learn
   - Data visualization with seaborn
   - Web scraping with BeautifulSoup

3. **Build a portfolio project**
   - Analyze a real dataset (Kaggle, data.gov)
   - Create visualizations
   - Share on GitHub
